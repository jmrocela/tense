Tense is a Simple Library to interact with REST Services over
HTTP. This library uses the cURL extension on PHP and recognizes
JSON results. This library can easily be Extended through Contexts,
a layer built on top of the Tense API. These contexts have the ability
to build a request and parse responses.

Tense has a small footprint and is very lightweight. Current features
are still limited to the GET aspect of the REST protocol, but will be
improved on later Iterations.
